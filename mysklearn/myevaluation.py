        Purpose: - Compute the F1 score (for binary classification), also known as balanced F-score or F-measure.
                 - The F1 score can be interpreted as a harmonic mean of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0.
                 - The relative contribution of precision and recall to the F1 score are equal.
                 - The formula for the F1 score is: F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

        labels(list of obj): - The list of possible class labels.
